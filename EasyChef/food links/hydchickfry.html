    <li>Clean and wash 500g of chicken pieces. Pat them dry and set aside.</li>
    <li>In a mixing bowl, add 2 tablespoons of ginger-garlic paste, 1 tablespoon of red chili powder, 1/2 teaspoon of turmeric powder, 1 tablespoon of coriander powder, 1 tablespoon of lemon juice, and salt to taste. Mix well to form a marinade.</li>
