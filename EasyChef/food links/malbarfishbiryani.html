  <h2>Process:</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Wash and soak 2 cups of basmati rice in water for 30 minutes. Drain the water and set aside.</li>
    <li>In a large pan, heat 2 tablespoons of ghee or oil. Add 1 sliced onion and sauté until golden brown.</li>
    <li>Add 1 tablespoon of ginger-garlic paste and sauté for 1-2 minutes until fragrant.</li>
    <li>Add 2 diced tomatoes, 1 teaspoon of turmeric powder, 1 teaspoon of red chili powder, 1 teaspoon of biryani masala, and salt to taste. Mix well.</li>
    <li>Add 500g of fish pieces (such as boneless fish fillets) and cook for 5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Add 1 cup of coconut milk and mix well. Cook for another 2 minutes.</li>
    <li>In a separate pot, bring water to a boil. Add the soaked rice and cook until it is 70-80% cooked. Drain the rice and set aside.</li>
    <li>In a large biryani pot or deep pan, layer half of the partially cooked rice at the bottom. Top it with the prepared fish masala.</li>
    <li>Add the remaining rice as the top layer and garnish with fried onions, chopped mint leaves, and coriander leaves.</li>
    <li>Cover the pot with a tight lid and cook on low heat for 20-25 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld and the rice to fully cook.</li>
    <li>Once done, gently mix the layers and serve hot Malabar Fish Biryani with raita or salad.</li>
